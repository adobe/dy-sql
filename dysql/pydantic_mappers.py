    Pydantic model that allows for results to be mapped into annotated fields without explicitly
    mapping each field. The metadata fields starting with "_" are special fields that allow lists, sets,
    and dictionaries to be mapped correctly if more than one record is mapped to an instance.

    Note that validation *does* occur the very first time map_record is called, but not on subsequent runs. Therefore
    if you desire better validation for list, set, or dict fields, that must most likely be done outside of pydantic.

    Additionally, lists, sets, and dicts will ignore null values from the database. Therefore you must provide default
    values for these fields when used or else validation will fail.
